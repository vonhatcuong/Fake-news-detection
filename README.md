# Fake_news_detection

Fake news is spreading on social platforms, newspapers... more and more widely. It is a matter of concern, as its negative effects cause much damage to the country and to society. In the world, there have also been many studies related to detecting fake news. In this project, we combine with the knowledge we have learned in Machine Learning and learn from document sources, to build a machine learning model that can produce news classification results. real, fake with the best measurements. By using tools like python scikit-learning, NLP to analyze text, perform encoding and extract features from text data. Then, a selection of Hyperparameters suitable for each model is used to achieve the highest accuracy. Here, I use 2 measures for my models accuracy and F1-macro. The best result is a Passive Aggressive model with feature extraction Tf-idf F1-macro : 0.95 and measure Accuracy: 0.94
